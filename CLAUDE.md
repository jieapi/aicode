## Build and Run

This is an Android application built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Hilt. It uses Gradle as the build system.

- **Build the project:** `./gradlew build`
- **Assemble Debug APK:** `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- **Assemble Release APK:** `./gradlew assembleRelease`
- **Run Unit Tests:** `./gradlew test`
- **Run Android Tests:** `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest`

*Note: The project locks `targetSdk = 28` intentionally to allow PRoot execution (W^X policy bypass on Android 10+).*

## Architecture

The application is structured using a feature-based architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. It relies heavily on Jetpack Compose for the UI, Hilt for Dependency Injection, and Kotlin Coroutines/Flows for asynchronous operations.

### Key Components

- **App Core:** `AIEditorApp` initializes core services like `FileLogger`, `TerminalKeepaliveService`, and `McpManager`.
- **Feature Modules:** Code is organized by feature under `app/src/main/java/com/aicodeeditor/feature/`:
    - `agent`: The core AI agent system. Includes prompt management, MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, tool registry (file tools, shell execution, etc.), permission handling, and adapters for different AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI).
    - `git`: Git integration and operations.
    - `settings`: Application configuration, including AI provider setup, logging, and keepalive settings.
    - `terminal`: Terminal emulation and session management, leveraging Termux components (`terminal-emulator`, `terminal-view`) and PRoot via `LinuxContainerEngine`.
    - `workspace`: Workspace and document provider management.

### Database

The app uses Room for local database storage, primarily found in `feature/agent/data/local/database/AgentDatabase.kt` and related DAOs (e.g., `ChatSessionDao`, `AgentMessageDao`).

### AI Agent & Tools

The AI agent interacts with the environment through a tool system (`feature/agent/domain/tool/`). Available tools include file operations (`FileTools.kt`), shell execution (`ExecuteCommandTool.kt`), and asking user questions. Tools are registered and managed via `ToolRegistry`. Permission to execute certain tools (like shell commands) is governed by `ToolPermissionManager` and `ToolPermissionPolicyEngine`.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The app implements an MCP client (`feature/agent/domain/mcp/`) to connect to remote servers and dynamically register tools provided by those servers.

### Dependency Injection

Hilt is used extensively. Feature modules define their own DI modules (e.g., `AgentModule.kt`, `RepositoryModule.kt`) to provide interfaces to their implementations.
